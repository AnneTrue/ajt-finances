Personal finances system built atop Google Apps Scripts and Google Sheets

Not included with this repo is the Google Sheet itself.
There are three features the Sheet provides:
* Accounting input
* Record database (storage)
* Google Chart creation

However, a minimal working sheet can be created from the scripts.
